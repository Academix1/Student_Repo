### **Day 1: GitHub and Git Creation, Token Generation, and Setting Up Token**

**Concepts Covered:**
1. **GitHub and Git Setup**
   - Introduction to GitHub and Git.
   - GitHub Account Creation and Setup.
   - Installing Git on your machine.

2. **Token Generation**
   - **GitHub Personal Access Tokens**: 
     - Importance of access tokens for authentication when working with remote repositories.
     - Generating a personal access token on GitHub:
       - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens.
       - Create a token with required permissions.

   - **Setting Up Token**:
     - Configure Git to use the generated token instead of the password for authentication.
     - Command: 
       ```bash
       git remote set-url origin https://<username>:<personal-access-token>@github.com/<username>/<repository>.git
       ```
     - First time you push to GitHub after setup, Git will prompt for the username and token.

   - Cloning an existing repository from GitHub to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```

2. **git add**
   - Staging changes for commit:
     ```bash
     git add <file-name>   # Add a single file
     git add .             # Add all changes
     ```

3. **git commit**
   - Committing changes to the local repository:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Commit message"
     ```

### **Day 3: Git (Fork) and Pull Request**

**Concepts Covered:**
1. **git fork**
   - Forking a repository on GitHub to create a personal copy for making contributions:
     - Use the "Fork" button on GitHub to create a forked repository.

2. **Creating a Pull Request (PR)**
   - Once you’ve made changes on your fork, create a pull request (PR) to submit changes back to the original repository.
     - Go to your GitHub repository → Click on "New Pull Request".
     - Review changes and submit the PR for review by the project maintainers.
     - Example PR message:
       - “Added feature XYZ to improve functionality.”

### **Day 4: Git Init & Push, Branch (Local) [git branch, switch/checkout], Branch (Remote) [Fetch, Pull, Stash]**

**Concepts Covered:**
1. **git init & Push**
   - Initializing a new Git repository and pushing it to a remote:
     ```bash
     git init            # Initialize local repository
     git add .           # Stage changes
     git commit -m "Initial commit"  # Commit changes
     git remote add origin <repository-url>  # Add remote URL
     git push -u origin master  # Push to remote
     ```

2. **Branching (Local)**
   - **git branch**: Creating a new branch:
     ```bash
     git branch <branch-name>
     ```
   - **git checkout**: Switching to a different branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout <branch-name>
     ```
   - **git switch**: A more modern way to switch between branches:
     ```bash
     git switch <branch-name>
     ```

3. **Branching (Remote)**
   - **git fetch**: Fetching the latest changes from the remote repository without merging:
     ```bash
     git fetch
     ```
   - **git pull**: Fetching and merging changes from the remote repository into your local branch:
     ```bash
     git pull origin <branch-name>
     ```
   - **git stash**: Temporarily storing changes that are not ready to commit:
     ```bash
     git stash
     git stash pop    # Apply stashed changes
     ```

### **Day 5: GitHub Actions and GitHub CI/CD**

**Concepts Covered:**

1. **GitHub Actions Basics**
   - Introduction to **GitHub Actions**: What they are and how they help automate workflows directly within GitHub.
   - How to create a `.github/workflows` directory in your project and add YAML configuration files to define workflows.
   - A simple GitHub Actions example:
     ```yaml
     name: CI Workflow
     on:
       push:
         branches:
           - main
     jobs:
       build:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
           - name: Checkout code
             uses: actions/checkout@v2
           - name: Set up Node.js
             uses: actions/setup-node@v2
             with:
               node-version: '14'
           - name: Install dependencies
             run: npm install
           - name: Run tests
             run: npm test
     ```


2. **GitHub CI/CD Workflow**
   - **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**:
     - Setting up continuous integration (CI) for testing, building, and verifying code changes before they are merged.
     - Continuous deployment (CD) to automatically deploy your code to a production or staging environment.
     - Example setup for building, testing, and deploying a Node.js application.
     - Common tools for integration (e.g., `npm`, `Docker`, `AWS CLI`, `Azure CLI`).

   - **Common Workflow Triggers**:
     - `push`, `pull_request`, `schedule`, and `workflow_dispatch`.
     - Example of triggering a workflow on `push` to the main branch:
       ```yaml
       on:
         push:
           branches:
             - main
       ```

3. **Testing GitHub Actions**
   - Triggering workflows manually through GitHub (via the UI).
   - Debugging GitHub Actions failures.
   - View logs for each step in the GitHub Actions UI.

### **Day 6: GitHub HotFix Deployment and Netlify Previews**

**Concepts Covered:**

1. **GitHub HotFix Deployment**
   - **Hotfix Deployment Concept**: Deploying a critical fix or patch to production quickly, usually outside of the normal release cycle.
   - Workflow for creating and deploying a hotfix using GitHub Actions:
     - Create a separate branch for hotfixes (e.g., `hotfix/<issue-number>`).
     - Use GitHub Actions to deploy the fix to a staging or production environment immediately after the fix is committed.
   - Example hotfix deployment action:
     ```yaml
     name: Hotfix Deployment
     on:
       push:
         branches:
           - hotfix/*
     jobs:
       deploy:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
           - name: Checkout code
             uses: actions/checkout@v2
           - name: Deploy to Production
             run: ./deploy_prod.sh
     ```

2. **Netlify Previews**
   - **Netlify Previews**: Automatically preview the changes made on your branches before merging them into the main branch.
   - Setting up **Netlify Continuous Deployment (CD)** with GitHub:
     - Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify.
     - Configure Netlify to automatically deploy changes to preview environments for feature branches.
   - **Preview Links**: Netlify provides a unique preview URL for each branch that you can share with collaborators for feedback.
   - Example configuration in **Netlify.toml**:
     ```toml
     [build]
       publish = "build"
       command = "npm run build"
     ```
   - **Deployment and Preview Workflow**:
     - Trigger deployments when changes are pushed to feature branches, and Netlify creates preview deployments.
